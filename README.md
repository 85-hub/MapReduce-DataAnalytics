# MapReduce for Machine Learning and Data Analytics
#### ENGG4030 Course Project 

> This is the course projects of ENGG4030 Web-scale Info Analytics, which aims to reproduce classic Machine Learning and Data Science algorithms for Hadoop. Below are Python and Java implementation of these algorithms.

#### Environment 
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Hadoop version: 2.7.X

#### Contents
* Community Detection in Online Social Networks: 
	* Calculate the similarity between users
	* Similarity is based on who they follow
	* In total 2.5M users

* Find Frequent Itemset:
	* A-Priori Algorithm
	* SON Algorithm
	* PCY Algorithm

* Clustering
	* K-Means Clustering
	* Bernoulli Mixture Models
	* Expectation-Maximization Algorithm
