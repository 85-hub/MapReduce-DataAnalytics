	* In total 2.5M users

2. Find Frequent Itemset:
	* A-Priori Algorithm
	* SON Algorithm
	* PCY Algorithm

3. Clustering
    * K-Means Clustering
    * Bernoulli Mixture Models
    * Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

4. Dimension Clustering Reduction
    * K-Means with PCA
    * Gaussian Mixture Models with PCA
