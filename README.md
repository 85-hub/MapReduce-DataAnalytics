# MapReduce for Data Analytics
#### ENGG4030 Course Project 

> This is the course projects of ENGG4030 Web-scale Info Analytics, which aims to reproduce classic Machine Learning and Data Science algorithms for Hadoop. Below are Python and Java implementation of these algorithms.

#### Environment 
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Hadoop version: 2.7.X

#### Contents
1. Community Detection in Online Social Networks: 
* Calculate the similarity between users
* Similarity is based on who they follow
* In total 2.5M users

2. Find Frequent Itemset:
* A-Priori Algorithm
* SON Algorithm
* PCY Algorithm

3. Clustering
* K-Means Clustering
* Bernoulli Mixture Models
* Expectation-Maximization Algorithm

4. Dimension Reduction
* K-Means with PCA
